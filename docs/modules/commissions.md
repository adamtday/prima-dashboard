## üé™ User Stories & Demo Scenarios

### Epic: Commission Structure Management

#### Story 1: Create Performance-Based Commission Tiers
**As a** Venue Admin  
**I want to** create multiple commission tiers based on promoter performance levels  
**So that** I can reward high performers while maintaining appropriate margins

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create commission tiers with names, rates, and qualification criteria
- [ ] Set different commission percentages for different performance levels
- [ ] Define minimum booking or revenue thresholds for each tier
- [ ] Configure automatic tier progression rules
- [ ] Set tier-specific benefits beyond just commission rates
- [ ] Preview financial impact across all current promoters
- [ ] Save and activate new commission structure

**Demo Flow:**
1. Navigate to Commissions ‚Üí Tier Management
2. Create "VIP" tier: 15% commission, requires 50+ monthly bookings
3. Create "Professional" tier: 12% commission, requires 25+ monthly bookings  
4. Create "Standard" tier: 8% commission, no minimum requirements
5. Set automatic progression: 3 consecutive months at threshold = tier upgrade
6. Preview impact: Show current vs. projected commission costs
7. Activate new structure for next pay period

#### Story 2: Smart Promoter Assignment to Tiers
**As a** Venue Manager  
**I want to** automatically assign promoters to appropriate commission tiers based on their performance  
**So that** tier assignments are fair and based on objective criteria

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] View all promoters with current tier assignments
- [ ] See qualification status for each tier (qualified/not qualified/pending)
- [ ] Manually override automatic assignments when justified
- [ ] Bulk assign multiple promoters to new tiers
- [ ] Set effective dates for tier changes
- [ ] Generate assignment change notifications for affected promoters
- [ ] Maintain audit trail of all assignment changes

**Demo Flow:**
1. Navigate to Commissions ‚Üí Promoter Assignments
2. View promoter list with performance metrics and current tiers
3. Identify promoter eligible for VIP tier upgrade (55 monthly bookings)
4. Apply automatic upgrade with next pay period effective date
5. Show promoter notification preview
6. Bulk assign 5 new promoters to Standard tier
7. Export assignment changes for HR communication

#### Story 3: Commission Impact Analysis
**As a** Venue Admin  
**I want to** preview the financial impact of commission changes before implementing them  
**So that** I can ensure changes align with profitability targets

**Acceptance Criteria:**

5. Show margin impact: Revenue growth projected to offset cost increase
6. Break down by tier: VIP tier cost increase offset by new enrollments
7. Export analysis for CFO review

#### Story 4: Commission Precedence and Conflict Resolution
**As a** Venue Admin

  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getStructures: builder.query({
      providesTags: ['Structure'],
      keepUnusedDataFor: 600, // 10 minutes - stable data
    }),
    getAssignments: builder.query({
      providesTags: ['Assignment'],
      keepUnusedDataFor: 300, // 5 minutes - moderately dynamic
    }),
    calculateImpact: builder.query({
