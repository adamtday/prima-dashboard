## Implementation Guidelines

### Sequential Dependencies
Each RFC MUST be completed before the next begins:
- **001→002→003**: Foundation layer
- **004**: Dashboard (needs layout + data)
- **005**: Bookings (needs dashboard patterns)
- **006**: Pricing (needs booking integration)
- **007**: Promoters (needs booking + pricing data)
- **008**: Finance (needs promoter + commission data)
- **009→010**: Advanced features (need financial base)
- **011→012**: Administrative and polish features

### Quality Gates
Before proceeding to next RFC:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Integration tests with all previous RFCs pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness confirmed

### Demo Scenario Readiness
- **Demo 1 (Multi-Venue)**: Ready after RFC-005
- **Demo 2 (Revenue Control)**: Ready after RFC-006
- **Demo 3 (Promoter Performance)**: Ready after RFC-007
- **Demo 4 (Financial Operations)**: Ready after RFC-008
- **Demo 5 (Loss Management)**: Ready after RFC-005

## Implementation Prompts

All RFCs follow the same implementation prompt pattern established in RFC-001 and RFC-002, with:
- Clear context of previous RFC dependencies
- Specific integration requirements
- Design system preservation rules
- Performance and accessibility standards
- Comprehensive testing requirements

Each implementation prompt ensures the developer understands:
1. What was built in previous RFCs
2. How to integrate with existing functionality
3. What patterns to follow for consistency
4. How to maintain quality standards
5. What will be built upon this RFC in the future

This framework ensures systematic, quality-driven development with each RFC building upon a solid foundation while maintaining architectural integrity and design system consistency.
